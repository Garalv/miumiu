"End-to-end virtual PBX"

NOTES
- Want to avoid SIP, as it's insane.

UNASSIGNED
- Lookup addresses in iPhone address book

- Have local (managed) address book

- Web mgmt interface for internal address book, extensions, etc ???

- Get incoming calls working
 - Modal dialog
 - External ringing
 - Answer/ignore

- BUG: when phone screen goes to sleep during a call, a touch of the screen
  should (hopefully) bring the display back.

- Call features:
 - timer
 - hold
 - mute
 - speakerphone 

- Dialing features:
 - backspace

- Hide/lock keypad when phone is close to ones ear

- Figure out why audio sans headset sucks

VTOR
- (Slacker!)


DIVAD
- Write up solid business model/plan
 - Research Apple's licensing/distribution terms
  - How will they react to VoIP over 3G? Probably not too well.
 - Determine whether or not they'll block/sue us
 - Look into ad-hoc distribution
